# Chess.sh
Multiplayer Chess Server over SSH

# Roadmap:
- [] Get the core game to work
- [] Have the game just manipulate a text file, and have argv parameters specify the file, and the operations performed on it.
- [] Multiplayer support over SSH (see [netris.rocketnine.space](https://code.rocket9labs.com/tslocum/netris))
